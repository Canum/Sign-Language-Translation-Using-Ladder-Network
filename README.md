# Sign Language Translation Using Ladder Network

In the realm of multi-modal communication, sign language is, and continues to be, one of the most understudied areas. In
line with recent advances in the field of deep learning, there are far reaching implications and applications that neural networks can
have for sign language interpretation In this paper translation of sign language network into text is being done using significantly
fewer lower labelled data than the traditional model. By using convolution Ladder Network ,it us demonstrated how it can perform this
task by achieving superior performance while using 80% less data as compared to the traditional convolution neural network.
